                <p className='text-2xl'>Youâ€™ve spent hours researching safe cars and car seats, and finally selected the right choices for your family. You've even had your car seat inspected at an inspection station to make sure you installed it correctly. But did you know there are other dangers in and around your vehicle that could seriously harm or even kill your child?

            <h1 className='font-bold text-3xl  mt-14 text-yellow-700'>Seat Belt Entanglement</h1>
            <p>A child within reach of a seat belt may become entangled if he or she pulls the seat belt all the way out and wraps the belt around his or her head, neck, or waist.

The majority of seat belts have a locking mechanism that is activated when the seat belt is pulled all the way out from the retractor. This feature is designed for car seat installation. In instances when the locking feature activates, the child may not be able to free him or herself.

This can happen if you do not properly restrain your child, for example, if you let the child lie down or sleep on the vehicle seat instead of being properly restrained. Older children who are no longer in a car seat can become entangled by pulling a seat belt all the way out of the retractor or by playing with an unused seat belt.</p>

            <p>Children can hurt themselves with power windows. Many kids are injured when a window closes on their finger, wrist, or hand. Some kids have been strangled by power windows.

            <p>Many children are killed or seriously injured in backover incidents. A backover incident typically occurs when a vehicle coming out of a driveway or parking space backs over an unattended child because the driver did not see him or her.</p>
