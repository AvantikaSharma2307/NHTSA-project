                <p className='text-2xl'>As you might expect, when a crash occurs between a vehicle and a bike, it’s the cyclist who is most likely to be injured. In this section, you’ll learn bicycle safety tips and rules of the road, from properly fitting your helmet to driving defensively and predictably. Find out what you can do to prevent bicycle injuries and deaths, and remember: A large percentage of crashes can be avoided if motorists and cyclists follow the rules of the road and watch out for each other.

                <li className='mb-4'><h1 className='text-3xl font-bold mb-4'>Helmets</h1><p>Every bike ride begins with putting on a helmet. But it’s equally important that you ensure a proper fit so your helmet can best protect you. 

Size can vary between manufacturers. Follow the steps to fit a helmet properly. It may take time to ensure a proper helmet fit, but your life is worth it. It’s usually easier to look in the mirror or have someone else adjust the straps. For the most comprehensive list of helmet sizes according to manufacturers, go the Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute (BHSI) website.

                Ride a bike that fits you—if it’s too big, it’s harder to control the bike.
Ride a bike that works—it really doesn’t matter how well you ride if the brakes don’t work.
Wear equipment to protect you and make you more visible to others, like a bike helmet, bright clothing (during the day), reflective gear, and a white front light and red rear light and reflectors on your bike (at night, or when visibility is poor).
Ride one per seat, with both hands on the handlebars, unless signaling a turn.
Carry all items in a backpack or strapped to the back of the bike.
Tuck and tie your shoe laces and pant legs so they don’t get caught in your bike chain.
Plan your route—if driving as a vehicle on the road, choose routes with less traffic and slower speeds. Your safest route may be away from traffic altogether, in a bike lane or on a bike path.</p></li>
                <li className='mb-4'><h1 className='text-3xl font-bold mb-4'>Drivers: Share the Road</h1><p>
                Yield to bicyclists as you would motorists and do not underestimate their speed. This will help avoid turning in front of a bicyclist traveling on the road or sidewalk, often at an intersection or driveway.
In parking lots, at stop signs, when packing up, or when parking, search your surroundings for other vehicles, including bicycles.
Drivers turning right on red should look to the right and behind to avoid hitting a bicyclist approaching from the right rear. Stop completely and look left-right-left and behind before turning right on red.
Obey the speed limit, reduce speed for road conditions and drive defensively to avoid a crash with a cyclist.
Give cyclists room. Do not pass too closely. Pass bicyclists as you would any other vehicle—when it’s safe to move over into an adjacent lane.</p></li>
