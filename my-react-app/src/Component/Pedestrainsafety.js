                <p className='text-2xl'>At some point in the day, everyone is a pedestrian. Unfortunately, pedestrian injuries and fatalities remain high. In 2021, 7,388 pedestrians were killed – a 13% increase from 2020 – and more than 60,000 pedestrians were injured nationwide. NHTSA raises awareness of the dangers to pedestrians and provides tips to keep pedestrians safe.

            <ul className='list-disc'>
                <li>Look out for pedestrians everywhere, at all times.</li>
                <li>Use extra caution when driving in hard-to-see conditions, such as nighttime or bad weather.</li>
                <li>Slow down and be prepared to stop when turning or otherwise entering a crosswalk.</li>
                <li>Yield to pedestrians in crosswalks and stop well back from the crosswalk to give other vehicles an opportunity to see the crossing pedestrians so they can stop too.
</li>
                <li>Never pass vehicles stopped at a crosswalk. There may be people crossing where you can’t see.
</li>
                <li>Never drive under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs.</li>
                <li>Follow the speed limit, especially around people on the street, in school zones and in neighborhoods where children are present.
</li>
                <li>Be extra cautious when backing up and look for pedestrians.</li>

                <li>Follow the rules of the road and obey signs and signals.</li>
                <li>Walk on sidewalks whenever they are available.
</li>
                <li>If there is no sidewalk, walk facing traffic and as far from traffic as possible.</li>
                <li>Cross streets at crosswalks or intersections. Look for cars in all directions, including those turning left or right.
</li>
                <li>If a crosswalk or intersection is not available, locate a well-lit area where you have the best view of traffic. Wait for a gap in traffic that allows enough time to cross safely; continue watching for traffic as you cross.
</li>
                <li>Watch for cars entering or exiting driveways, or backing up in parking lots.</li>
                <li>Avoid alcohol and drugs when walking; they impair your abilities and your judgment.
</li>
                <li>Embrace walking as a healthy form of transportation - get up, get out and get moving.
</li>
